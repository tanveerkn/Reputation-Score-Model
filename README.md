## Description
These scripts are used to extract different features for twitter user and are then used to calculate the reputation score for each twitter users. We generate a dataset for 500 twitter users and then used different regression models to find the one that best fit to our model.

## Organization
The project consist of the following files:
### data_set.csv
The datasetr consist of the 20 features of 500 twitter users including the reputation score for eah user. These features consist of both the user level and content level entities.

- Index score for the number of re-tweets and likes

### twitter_reputation.ipynb
This is a google colab file and is used for training and evaluationg different regression models.
Train three regression models:
1. Multilayr perceptron
2. Deep neural network
3. Linear regression
### twitter_credentials.py
You need to authenticate yourself by providing the credentils given in this file.
### twitter_user_names.txt
